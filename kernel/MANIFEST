This directory contains kernel patches currently necessary/useful for
Bay Trail-m devices which have not landed in linus' current tree (or
in Fedora's Rawhide kernel).

These, of course, should be considered to be licensed under the GPLv2, not
MIT.

The fedlet kernel build also includes a large patch series to enable sound. It
is not carried in this git repo because it'd be tedious to do so. You can
generate the patch series by doing:

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lrg/asoc.git
cd asoc
git checkout intel/haswell-audio-dsp
git format-patch 38dbfb59d1175ef458d006556061adeaa8751b72 (currently - just
generate a patch series going back to whatever upstream commit he's currently
working on top of, that commit ID is for 3.14rc1, so if he rebases to a newer
upstream at any point the ID to use will change).

lrg/asoc.git is Liam Girdwood's ASoC dev repo, and intel/haswell-audio-dsp is
the branch he's using to work on Haswell/Broadwell/Baytrail SoC audio support.
The patches are gradually being merged upstream and the tree will likely be
unneeded by 3.14 final or 3.15 final or so. Follow alsa-devel mailing list if
you want to follow the upstreaming.
